/// Some type of testing might not handle large collections or do have
/// unacceptable performance when using big collections, so in those cases the
/// collection size need to be kept small.
///
/// Other code under test might handle large collections well, but large
/// collections still take more time to generate than small collections.
/// Therefore, in this generator, the maximum possible generated example size
/// value progressively grows when iterating over the examples, first trying
/// with small sizes before continouing with larger sizes.

/// All in all, this should hopefully ensure a good test coverage, first testing
/// with small sizes and later on with possibly larger ones too, hitting a good
/// balance between test coverage and performance.
